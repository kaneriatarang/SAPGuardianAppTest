The myth that Britain â€œstood aloneâ€ in the Second World War and that Europe was then liberated from â€œour island fortressâ€ was woven by Margaret Thatcher in her 1988 Bruges speech and became one of the driving fictions of Brexit.</p> <p>â€œWhere is Global Britain in the streets of Kabul?â€ was a little rich coming from Theresa May, who declared, when triggering article 50 of the Lisbon treaty in 2017: â€œI want Britain to beâ€¦ a great, global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong, united and confident at home.â€</p> <p>Now that the Atlantic alliance is broken, our international influence is in tatters, we have burned our bridges with Europe and the country is weak, divided and fearful, it is high time that we took a long, hard look at ourselves and our place in the world before the nonsense of imperial fantasy sweeps us on to the rocks of any more historic humiliations.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Robert Gildea</strong>, professor emeritus of modern history<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">University of Oxford<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <p>One can perhaps forgive Americans for botching the Afghanistan campaign but the British, who fought the Afghans three times â€“ in 1839, 1878 and 1919 â€“ should have known better (â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/22/observer-editorial-afghanistan-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">It wonâ€™t do to blame the US for Britainâ€™s humiliation</a>â€, Editorial).</p> <p>When, before the first Anglo-Afghan war of 1839, Lord Auckland, the head of the British invading force, asked the Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of Punjab, to undertake the responsibility of invading Kabul, the maharaja refused; he knew only too well that they were easy to conquer but difficult to rule; that they were a mosaic of competing tribes, which ensured that no strong central authority maintained its power over them for too long. It is a pity that western leaders could not foresee in 2001 what Maharaja Ranjit Singh could in 1839.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Randhir Singh Bains</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Gants Hill, London<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <p>Sippi Azarbaijani-Moghaddam offers a reality check to counter the over-rosy western view of progress in Afghanistan (â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/22/p-was-always-fitful-many-afghan-women-felt-unsafe-before-the-talibans-arrival\" title=\"\">Progress was always fitful. Many Afghan women felt unsafe before the Talibanâ€™s arrival</a>â€, Comment). Too many are exaggerating the improvements in life for women and girls, perhaps compelled by the necessity to justify their outlay in blood and treasure over the past 20 years. Three-quarters of the population live in rural areas and only just over half of Afghan men are literate, while the female literacy rate is under 30%. Female doctors, lawyers, judges and journalists are doubtless shining examples of what can be achieved if girls are given half a chance but basic schooling is still a pipe dream for the overwhelming majority.</p> <p>Western governments are too eager to make wildly upbeat claims for their influence in raising womenâ€™s status during the past two decades. The country remains for the most part desperately poor, with most people struggling to make a basic living. Most girls are married by 19, the most common ages being 15 or 16, and the fertility rate at five children per woman is the highest outside Africa.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Jennifer Rees</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Cardiff<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <h2>A recovery for the few</h2> <p>In answer to Will Huttonâ€™s question (â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/22/british-capitalism-booming-now-it-must-change-its-spots\" title=\"\">As the economy bounces back, do we sceptics need to say we got it wrong?</a>â€, Comment), a resounding no! As his brilliant analysis reveals, the â€œrecoveryâ€ has delivered much more for the few than for the many. And the cracks that have appeared over the past year â€“ in the NHS, social care and other public services stretched beyond breaking point â€“ will only get wider unless fundamental change comes soon.</p> <p>Better informed and caring policies, backed by a fairer taxation system, are long overdue. The sustainable economic, social and environmental policies that apply in Wales are one model for this, comparing favourably with the UK governmentâ€™s mix of optimistic rhetoric, short-term â€œfixesâ€ and rush to get back to â€œbusiness as usualâ€.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Kay S Powell</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Llandaff, Cardiff<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <h2>Brexit: all about the emotions</h2> <p>I am a paid-up and enthusiastic anti-Brexiter. I read with joy the articles by William Keegan in particular, such as â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/22/global-britain-badly-needs-a-new-driver-at-the-wheel\" title=\"\">We need a new driver at the wheel of â€˜Global Britainâ€™</a>â€ (Business). </p> <p>However, I fear that, by emphasising the rational economic arguments, he and many others miss the main point. It is that both those for and against Brexit have a view based not on economic but on emotional grounds. Those who oppose EU membership do so because they see the EU as a foreign, dysfunctional, money-wasting, dictatorial organisation from which they want freedom and independence. The anti-Brexiteers see the EU as a force for good and like the idea of being closely associated with other European democracies.</p> <p>Such views wonâ€™t be changed by presenting the economic arguments and that is why there is no evidence of â€œbuyerâ€™s remorseâ€. Polls indicate few have changed their mind over the last five years, despite the evidence of the economic pain inflicted on the UK since we left the EU.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Arnold Glickman</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Pinner, London<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <h2>Who are the real extremists?</h2> <p>So Priti Patel regards Extinction Rebellion activists as â€œextremistsâ€, a group of â€œcriminals who threaten the nationâ€™s way of lifeâ€ (â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/21/wrong-to-label-extinction-rebellion-as-extremists-says-home-office-adviser\" title=\"\">XR supporters are not â€˜extremeâ€™ â€“ Patel adviser</a>â€, News). Such a view demands critical scrutiny. Shami Chakrabarti, the former shadow attorney general, rightly points to the â€œsloppy lack of legal definitionâ€, which is a shocking failing in a home secretary.</p> <p>But there is more to be unpacked here with regard to notions of extremism. One could say that climatic and ecological effects so extreme that they present an existential threat can be effectively addressed only by fundamental, ie extreme, systemic change. Put the other way round, these extreme effects arise as the result of the continued burning of fossil fuels and exploitation of nature and people, so the real extremists are those who profit from and perpetuate such business and those who do nothing to change the world economy and the way we live.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Teresa Belton</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Norwich<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <h2>Lessons from Stockton</h2> <p>The demise of the traditional high street may well be exaggerated, if the example of the leadership, vision and entrepreneurial energy shown by the council of Stockton-on-Tees is anything to go by (â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/21/forget-shops-how-stockton-on-tees-ripped-up-the-rule-book-to-revive-its-high-street\" title=\"\">Never mind the shops, focus on parks, theatresâ€¦ and people</a>â€, Focus). Symbolised by the revival of the Globe, a Grade II art deco theatre, their message is about creating a greater sense of community and local identity by moving away from an emphasis on mere consumption to one of promoting genuine participation and wellbeing.</p> <p>That certainly resonates here in Harborne, a couple of miles from Birmingham city centre, where we too have an art deco Grade II cinema but one thatâ€™s now a sad shadow of its former self, a casualty of long-term public and private neglect. Harborne Royalty Trust has put forward proposals on how this building could be restored for a diversity of uses such as a cinema, theatre, music venue, and other activities. Indeed, a public consultation demonstrated overwhelming backing for such plans, rather than seeing the Royalty make way for further residential apartments, which could happen if our council fails to heed the lesson from Stockton.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Rob Sutton</strong>, chair<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Harborne Royalty Trust<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Harborne, Birmingham<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p>",

Hubris followed inevitably by nemesis.<br><strong>Jane Ghosh</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>â€¢ Much has been written of late about how Afghanistan is being abandoned by its western allies, and parallels are inevitably being drawn with the US withdrawal from Vietnam. But perhaps those parallels should be pushed a little further. The government of South Vietnam was massively corrupt, with little popular support. Those were two of the reasons why it fell. Is it worth asking where the billions of dollars poured into Afghanistan have gone and why its government seems unable to defend itself? And what, now, is the alternative? Permanent colonisation of Afghanistan in a world where â€œcolonisationâ€ has rightly become a dirty word?<br><strong>Prof Trevor Curnow </strong><br><em>Lancaster</em></p> <p>â€¢ The disaster we are watching unfold in Afghanistan should put to rest the idea that there is such a thing as US â€œmoral leadershipâ€. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\" title=\"\">President Biden</a> has all but abandoned the country to a regime of medieval savagery and backwardness. A generation of Afghan women and girls is seeing its rights, freedom and dreams cruelly snuffed out. It is sickening to behold.<br><strong>Daniel Peacock</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>â€¢ Among the many shameful aspects of the westâ€™s abandonment of Afghanistan, we now learn that those young Afghans admitted to UK universities next month will be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58219114\" title=\"\">denied the places</a> they had won on merit, apparently because embassy staff could not complete the paperwork in time. Can I suggest that every university with potential students from this sad country might band together and charter a plane to bring as many as are able to leave at once? Iâ€™m sure the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office\" title=\"\">Home Office</a> will be able to deal with the â€œpaperworkâ€ once these young people are safely in the UK. <br><strong>Sir Martin Harris</strong><br><em>Former vice-chancellor, universities of Essex and Manchester</em></p> <p>â€¢ Ten years ago I worked for a British refugee charity on a government-funded scheme to encourage asylum seekers to voluntarily return to their home countries. Among others, we dealt with Afghans, and they returned under the belief that life would be relatively safe (although interestingly, it was never deemed safe enough for us, British workers to visit the country). Have we not let these people down? Have we not betrayed all the Afghan women who have resumed education and roles outside the home? And what about the journalists, the artists, those who engaged with a fragile democracy? Many of these people will be targets now. Involvement in civil society leaves a digital footprint that is hard to erase. I feel guilty myself, and on behalf of my country. The least we can do is give generously to the agencies on the ground who will soon be dealing with millions of refugees.<br><strong>Caroline Willcocks</strong><br><em>Bromyard, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>â€¢ I write to ask that the Guardian stops referring to Afghan women and female children being forced into â€œmarriageâ€ with Taliban men (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-talibans-advance-not-an-american-debacle-but-afghans-tragedy\" title=\"\">Editorial, 13 August</a>).

          "body": "<p>The Taliban are expected to announce a new government in Afghanistan within hours, as chaos in the country deepened and aid experts warned of imminent economic collapse.</p> <p> More than two weeks after the Islamist militia seized control, sources told Agence-France Presse that the cabinet could be presented after morning prayers on Friday and Ahmadullah Muttaqi, a Taliban official, said on social media that a ceremony was being prepared at the presidential palace in Kabul.</p> <p>The private broadcaster Tolo said an announcement was imminent. The movementâ€™s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, is expected to have ultimate power over a new governing council, with a president below him, Taliban officials have said.</p> <p>The Islamist militants governed Afghanistan through an unelected leadership council, brutally enforcing a radical form of sharia law, from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted by US-led forces. Since their return, they have promised a softer brand of rule.</p> <p>However, the US, the EU and others have cast doubt on the groupâ€™s assurances, saying formal recognition of the new government â€“ and any economic aid that would follow â€“ will depend on the Talibanâ€™s actions in power.</p> <p>â€œWeâ€™re not going to take them at their word, weâ€™re going to take them at their deeds,â€ the US undersecretary of state, Victoria Nuland, said. The EU has said the new rulers will not be recognised until they form an inclusive government, respect human rights and provide unfettered access for aid workers.</p> <p>Haibatullah, a religious scholar from Kandahar whose son was a suicide bomber, is expected to play a theocratic role similar to that played by Iranâ€™s supreme leader. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder and deputy leader of the movement who was imprisoned in Pakistan, is likely to be appointed head of government.</p> <p>Other Taliban officials expected to hold senior positions include Sirajuddin Haqqani, another deputy leader, and Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of the Talibanâ€™s founder Mullah Muhammad Omar, who died in 2013.</p> <p>The new government will face enormous challenges. The UN has warned of a looming humanitarian catastrophe across the country of 40 million people amid a severe drought, growing food insecurity and the upheavals of a 20-year war that forced thousands of families to flee their homes.</p> <p>Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the World Food Programmeâ€™s country director in Afghanistan, told Reuters: â€œIn the current context there are no national safety nets â€¦ Since 15 August when the Taliban took over, we have seen the crisis accelerate and magnify with the imminent economic collapse that is coming this countryâ€™s way.</p> <p>â€œThe situation that we have unfolding at the moment is absolutely horrendous and could morph into just a humanitarian catastrophe,â€ she said, adding that since the Taliban takeover civil servantsâ€™ salaries were not being paid, the currency had depreciated, and banks have limited weekly withdrawals to $200.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/world/asia/afghanistan-us-occupation-ends.html?searchResultPosition=5\" title=\"\">Food stocks</a> distributed by the UN are likely to run out for much of the country by the end of September, the organisationâ€™s humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan has said, with shortages of food and other necessities already widely reported.</p> <p>Hours-long queues have formed outside banks and prices in Kabulâ€™s bazaars have soared. In one spot of brighter news, however, Western Union said on Thursday that it was restarting money transfer services to the country; many Afghans rely on remittances from relatives abroad to survive.</p> <p>Afghanistan desperately needs money, but despite assurances from the new Taliban-appointed central bank head, the Taliban are unlikely to get swift access to roughly $10bn (Â£7.25bn) in assets mostly held abroad by the Afghan central bank.</p> <p>In a sign of where Afghanistan may now turn for international assistance, Zabiullah Mujahid, an official spokesman for the new regime, <a href=\"https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2021/09/01/news/afghanistan_il_portavoce_dei_talebani_zabiullah_mujahid_chiediamo_all_italia_di_riconoscerci_la_cina_ci_finanziera_-316162722/?ref=RHTP-BH-I315657642-P2-S1-T1\">told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica</a> that China was â€œour main partner and represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us as the Chinese government is ready to invest and rebuild our countryâ€.</p> <p>Mujahid said the Taliban â€œcare a lot about the â€˜one belt, one roadâ€™ project. We own rich copper mines, which, thanks to the Chinese, will be modernised. Finally, China represents our ticket to the markets around the world.â€</p> <p>Asked about the Talibanâ€™s relationship with Russia, he said relations with Moscow were â€œmainly political and economic. Russia continues to mediate for us and with us to create the conditions for an international peaceâ€.</p> <p>The Taliban have promised to allow safe passage out of the country for any foreigners or Afghans left behind by the massive airlift that ended with the withdrawal of the last US troops on Monday, but Kabul airport remained closed on Thursday.</p> <p>Domestic flights from the airport, which will be vital for humanitarian operations, would resume on Friday, Al Jazeera reported, adding that while a Qatari technical team was assessing damage, the return of international air traffic that would allow further evacuations would take â€œsome timeâ€.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Taliban forces and fighters loyal to the resistance leader Ahmad Massoud continued to fight the Panjshir valley north of Kabul, with each side claiming it had inflicted heavy casualties.</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Taliban fighters had entered Panjshir and taken control of some territory. The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan rebel grouping, however, said it had full control of all passes and entrances and had driven back all incursions.</p> <p><em>With Reuters and AFP</em></p>",

Afghanistan and Iraq are contemporary examples.</p> <p>But concern about motive does not detract from the need to support and strengthen the international protection of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the framework of international humanitarian law which followed it were endorsed by almost every nation. The absence of an international police force â€“ a weakness in the structure â€“ increases the need for individual states to share responsibility for enforcement, particularly of international criminal law. The development of a â€œresponsibility to protectâ€, dismissed by Jenkins, gives legitimacy to necessary humanitarian intervention. Military action should be a last resort, but it cannot be ruled out of every situation where lives are at stake.</p> <p>Jenkinsâ€™ cynicism towards collective action to defend the oppressed and the vulnerable, with military support where necessary, suggests an affinity with a dangerous isolationist tendency in current political thinking. When global warming and violent ideologies pose threats which can only be met by international collaboration, we need more support for the maintenance of universal values. The Jenkins recipe â€“ â€œindividual nations best serve humanity by example or charityâ€ â€“ is too little, too late.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Geoffrey Bindman</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>London</em></p> <p><strong>â€¢ <em>Have an opinion on anything youâ€™ve read in the Guardian today?

          "body": "<p>As word of Kabulâ€™s fall to the Taliban spread across Afghanistan, there were few who greeted the news with as much fear as the Hazara Shias. The religious minority in this Sunni majority country were among the most persecuted groups when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, and the memories of the killings, torture and mass executions have not faded.</p> <p>Signs point to Hazaras once again finding themselves a target of the Taliban. A recent Amnesty report found that Taliban militants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/afghanistan-reports-of-torture-and-killing-contradict-taliban-promises\">responsible for the murder of nine Hazaras in July</a>, in the village of Mundarakht. Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off.</p> <p>Attacks such as these have prompted a mass exodus of Hazara people over the border to Pakistan, and activists say that about 10,000 have arrived in the Pakistan city of Quetta, in Balochistan, where they are living in mosques and wedding halls, and renting rooms. Several Hazaras told the Guardian they had paid traffickers from Â£50 to Â£350 to get them across the border.</p> <p>Among those sheltering in Quetta was Sher Ali, 24, a shopkeeper, who had escaped with his wife and baby. Ali reached Chaman on the Pakistan side of the frontier on Thursday. The journey, through territory controlled by the Taliban, had taken three days. They had driven along roads decimated by bomb blasts, passing burnt-out cars and destroyed bridges.</p> <p>Ali had decided to leave after he witnessed his friend Mohammad Hussain, 23, being shot dead by the Taliban 10 days ago in Kabul. Hussain had been passing through a Taliban security checkpoint on a motorbike. He refused to stop and they fired at him with an assault rifle.</p> <p>â€œWhen I went to the spot, Hussainâ€™s dead body was lying on the road in a pool of blood. They emptied the AK-47 on him,â€ said Ali. â€œIt was the moment I decided to leave. It is like a do or die situation for Hazara Shia; whether to leave and live, or stay and die.â€</p> <p>In recent days, there have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/27/everyone-is-afraid-afghans-fleeing-taliban-push-for-exit-into-pakistan\">chaotic scenes at the Chaman border crossing</a>, as tens of thousands of Afghans have attempted to make it across. Only those with Pakistan residency papers or people travelling to Pakistan for medical treatment are officially allowed in, but some of the Hazaras said traffickers would bribe authorities at the border to get Afghans across illegally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/27/everyone-is-afraid-afghans-fleeing-taliban-push-for-exit-into-pakistan\">â€˜Everyone is afraidâ€™: Afghans fleeing Taliban push for exit into Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ali said his remaining family members would be leaving for Pakistan within a few days. â€œWe canâ€™t live in the Talibanâ€™s Afghanistan,â€ he said.</p> <p>Mohammed Sharif Tahmasi, 21, a computer science student from Ghazni province, reached Chaman along with his two sisters and brother on Thursday. After making the border crossing, they waited in a muddy corner near the border fence for some more Hazara families so they could travel to Quetta together.</p> <p>Tahmasiâ€™s family has never been to Pakistan but his parents had given the children some money and instructed them to urgently get over the border as soon as they could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33dc56be9207e75e76243d93ef110c5b367027f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33dc56be9207e75e76243d93ef110c5b367027f/0_97_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"left to right Mohammad Sharif Tahmasi, Ashmatullah Tahmasi, Nahid Tahmasi and Umaira Tahmasi who fled Kabul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">left to right Mohammad Sharif Tahmasi, Ashmatullah Tahmasi, Nahid Tahmasi and Umaira Tahmasi who fled Kabul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shah Meer Baloch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>â€œAll Hazara parents are asking their children to leave Afghanistan and be safe,â€ said Tahmasi. â€œI donâ€™t know how my parents and the other siblings are, but I hope my siblings are fine and they will cross soon.â€</p> <p>Sharifâ€™s sister Nahid Tahmasi, 15, a student in an elementary school, said she did not want to abandon her parents but, before she had left Ghazni, Taliban restrictions on women had already begun to be enforced.</p> <p>â€œI feel terrible,â€ she said. â€œI canâ€™t go to school and I miss my city and friends. I miss my parents. I miss my school. When the Taliban took control of Ghazni province they banned girlsâ€™ entry into public parks and schools. They did not want girls to study. We could not roam outside, visit our neighbours and dress the way we want.â€</p> <p>Gulalai Haideri, a Hazara who worked as a teacher at the Women for Afghan Women NGO, in Faryab province, reached Quetta five days ago. She is pregnant and sold her jewellery to pay for the journey and to be smuggled across the border.</p> <p>â€œWe were rejected twice for entry but then I begged the guards to allow me to enter as I am pregnant and I canâ€™t live in Afghanistan. I am a woman, I will be killed,â€ she said. â€œThey had mercy and allowed my family to enter.â€</p> <p>Haideri said that after her province fell to the insurgents, the Taliban had been going door to door to find unmarried girls, orphaned girls, divorced women and widows to get married to their fighters. </p> <p>Mohammad Fahim Arvin, 21, a student at the Kabul Polytechnic University, was told by his parents to leave and save his life. But he spoke of his sadness at having to leave his parents behind.</p> <p>â€œThe Taliban hate us and want us to join them and fight for them, but we canâ€™t,â€ said Arvin. â€œIt is not my fault I was born as a Hazara; it was Godâ€™s decision. It was not in my hands. Why do they [Taliban] want to kill us for being Hazara?â€</p> <p>Yet even in Pakistan, the Hazaras are not in safe territory. Here too they have been persecuted for three decades by the Sunni militant groups. Earlier this year, 10 Hazara miners working in Balochistan were murdered by members of Islamic State. According to a 2019 report by Pakistanâ€™s National Commission for Human Rights, at least 509 Hazara have been murdered for their faith since 2013.</p> <p>For many of Afghanistanâ€™s Hazara community arriving into Pakistan with little money and no connections, they have had to rely on the kindness of the local community.</p> <p>Syed Nadir was among those hosting five Hazara families, including Haideriâ€™s family in Quetta who had arrived in recent days.</p> <p>â€œI donâ€™t know any of them, but all Hazara are going through one of the worst times,â€ he said. â€œThey are leaving their homes and we should host them. All countries should play their part for the Hazaras and the Afghans.â€</p> <p>â€¢ This article was amended on 30 August 2021. The 10 Hazara miners were murdered by members of IS, not executed as stated in an earlier version.</p>",

Boris Johnson will chair the virtual summit where, diplomatic sources have told Reuters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/24/g7-leaders-to-seek-unity-on-taliban-as-deadline-for-afghanistan-evacuation-looms\">G7 nations are expected to show unity on areas including whether to sanction or officially recognise the Taliban</a> to avoid humanitarian catastrophe, and on protecting the human rights of vulnerable groups.</p> \n<p>Efforts to get people out of the Afghan capital have continued with a rising sense of urgency as the 31 August cutoff draws closer. US special forces said on Monday they had retrieved 16 American citizens from a site two hours outside Kabul and brought them back to the airport for evacuation processing. As the effort continues, the British ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, has said the Taliban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/23/uk-scrambles-to-complete-airlift-out-of-kabul-after-warning-about-taliban\">will not tolerate western forces staying into September,</a> which the Taliban has said would â€œcross a red lineâ€ and â€œprovoke a reactionâ€.</p> \n<p>Speaking from Kabul, Bristow said: â€œThe signalling that weâ€™re seeing from the Taliban, including earlier today, is pretty uncompromising that they want the operation finished by the end of the month. So I think it follows from that, that if the US and its allies were to try to push beyond that, then thereâ€™s at least a risk there of us doing so in a much more difficult and less compliant environment.â€</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Women and girls at risk â€“ </strong>Police are failing to impose restraining orders or bail conditions on men accused of rape, domestic abuse, harassment and stalking, a watchdog has found.

Stop the War argued from our foundation in October 2001 that the war in Afghanistan would neither end terrorism nor establish a peaceful and democratic state. Twenty years on, despite vast political, military and financial support from the US and Britain, the Kabul government proved a Potemkin regime.</p> <p>Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The trillion-dollar cost of the war would have been better spent providing education, development and infrastructure. The Afghan people have now endured decades of war, largely imposed on them by western politicians. We must provide financial compensation and aid, not least by welcoming those who want to come here as refugees. We must also insist that our own government and MPs face up to the failures of the past two decades and call an end to the wars and interventions which have done so much damage across the world.

While the Taliban fought their way to Kabul and then besieged it? How many dead, starved, made homeless, orphaned, then?</p> <p>In my view, Biden and his close advisers knew that if the handover was to be done then it could only be done quickly. If the Taliban inherit a relatively undamaged state, there is a much better chance that they will be able to make it work and keep at least some of their moderate pledges.</p> <p>As Biden said, there was never going to be a good time to withdraw from Afghanistan.

None of the westâ€™s soldiers have died in vain: theirs was a noble cause. Itâ€™s quite possible that in the future some Afghans, particularly the young, having seen something better, will overthrow their oppressors.

          "body": "<p>Earlier this year, a bipartisan panel appointed by the US Congress <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/politics/afghanistan-biden-trump-troops-withdrawal.html\" title=\"\">advised</a> against the â€œprecipitous withdrawalâ€ of American troops from Afghanistan. The panel warned of grave consequences if Joe Biden allowed himself to be driven by dates and a strict timeline, rather than a realistic assessment of conditions on the ground. Mr Biden, who had inherited a 1 May exit deadline from Donald Trump, ignored this advice, naming instead a new date. All US forces would be gone by 11 September, exactly two decades after the invasion prompted by the al-Qaida attack on the World Trade Center.</p> <p>A timetable bound up with domestic political symbolism has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/who-are-the-taliban-and-how-will-they-govern-afghanistan-strict-islamic-beliefs\" title=\"\">handed</a> over Afghanistan to the Taliban and millions of Afghans to a frightening and unstable future. In the spring, a Biden administration official <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fnational-security%2fbiden-us-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan%2f2021%2f04%2f13%2f918c3cae-9beb-11eb-8a83-3bc1fa69c2e8_story.html\" title=\"\">said</a>: â€œWe went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked us on September 11th â€¦ We believe we achieved that objective some years ago.â€ These words were presumably intended to convey a pragmatic determination to end a â€œforever warâ€, as well as a neat sense of narrative closure. Today they read like an insular, inward-looking rationale for an abdication of responsibility that will scar the Biden presidency.</p> <p>For the thousands of Afghan citizens attempting to flee Kabul airport on Monday, there is no closure; only a sense of premature abandonment, and the beginning of an era in which they must navigate the likely brutalities, misogyny and authoritarianism of Taliban rule. Understandably unpersuaded by Taliban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/16/taliban-afghanistan-rule-hardline-coalition-powers\" title=\"\">reassurances</a> of a more moderate approach, many women and human rights activists have gone into hiding. With unseemly haste, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, has fled the country. Appalling footage of people apparently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\" title=\"\">falling</a> to their death, after clinging to departing planes, will stand as a lasting indictment of a foreign policy disaster for which ordinary Afghans are set â€“ once again â€“ to pay the price.</p> <p>The westâ€™s failure to understand the extent to which the Taliban used Doha peace talks to string Donald Trump and the US along, while preparing a lightning offensive, was a catastrophic intelligence lapse. To begin troop withdrawal at the beginning of the fighting season, while <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/without-u-s-contractors-afghan-military-will-lose-its-main-n1269686\" title=\"\">removing</a> vital logistical assistance to the Afghan air force and failing to develop contingency plans, was reckless. It speaks volumes for the lack of focus that the troop pullout, and subsequent Taliban advance, took place while some leaders, including, briefly, Boris Johnson and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, were on <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-dominic-raab-were-24770343\" title=\"\">holiday</a>.</p> <p>As the exodus of western nationals from Kabul continues, the US and British authorities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\" title=\"\">pledged</a> to expedite processes for Afghans eligible for visas. Everything that can be done must be done. But for large numbers, as the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2021/aug/16/uk-defence-secretary-ben-wallace-chokes-up-over-afghanistan-video\" title=\"\">acknowledged</a>, it will be too little, too late. Months of foot-dragging, administrative incompetence and the lack of a true sense of urgency mean that many will now be trapped. The Taliban control all routes to the airport in Kabul.</p> <p>This debacle will have profound and destabilising consequences for the region. It has undermined Mr Bidenâ€™s desire to rehabilitate Americaâ€™s reputation as a global humanitarian force, following the Trump presidency. A humiliating setback for the west will encourage Islamist terrorist groups around the world. But most directly and immediately, the desire to close the book on Afghanistan and move on has failed a people. After two decades of a western presence in their country, Afghans who had come to enjoy greater freedoms had a right to expect more care and attention to be paid to their fragile situation. Mr Biden, focused on consigning the 9/11 era of US foreign policy to history, has badly let them down.</p>",
